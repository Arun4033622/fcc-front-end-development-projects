  <h1 class="heading" >Contributions & Accomplishments</h1><br>
  <ul>
    <li><p>A paper on the particulate nature of light, in which he explained the <b>“photoelectric effect”</b> and certain other experimental results by proposing that light interacts with matter as discrete “packets” or quanta of energy, rather than as a wave (an idea first suggested by Max Planck as a purely mathematical manipulation).</p></li>
    <li><p>A paper explaining <b>Brownian motion</b> (the seemingly random movement of particles suspended in a fluid) as direct evidence of molecular action, thus supporting the atomic theory (that all matter is made up of tiny atoms and molecules).</p></li>
    <li><p>A paper, which has become known as the <b>Special Theory of Relativity</b>, on the electrodynamics of moving bodies, which showed that the speed of light is independent of the observer's state of motion, and introduced the idea that the space-time frame of a moving body could slow down and contract in the direction of motion relative to the frame of the observer.</p></li>
    <li><p>A paper on mass-energy equivalence, in which he deduced the famous equation <b>E = mc2</b> from his special relativity equations, suggesting that tiny amounts of mass could be converted into huge amounts of energy (which presaged the later development of nuclear power).</p></li>
    <li><p>He worked on thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics. He even worked on general relativity and applied the same to explain cosmology. The other work carried out by Einstein include Schrodinger gas model and Einstein refrigerator.</p></li><hr>
    <li><p>He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.</p></li>
    <li><p>In 1929, Einstein was presented with the Max Planck medal of the German Physical Society in Berlin.</p></li>
    <li><p>In 1936, he was awarded the Franklin Institute's Franklin Medal for his extensive work on relativity and the photo-electric effect.</p></li>
    <li><p>International Union of Pure and Applied Physics named 2005 as the "World Year of Physics" commemorating the 100th anniversary of the publication of the ‘annus mirabilis’ papers.</p></li>
    <li><p>Albert Einstein has to his name a science park, located on the hill, Telegrafenberg in Potsdam, Germany. The park has a tower by the name, Einstein Tower which is an astrophysical, built to perform checks of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.</p></li>
    <li><p>Washington DC houses the Albert Einstein Memorial. In it is a monumental bronze statue depicting Einstein seated with manuscript papers in hand.</p></li>
    <li><p>Four months after his death, the chemical element 99 (einsteinium) was named for him.</p></li>
    <li><p>The Time magazine, in 1999, named Einstein as the Person of the Century..</p></li><li><p>The United States Postal Service honored Einstein with a Prominent Americans series 8  postage stamp.</p></li>
    <li><p>In 2008, Einstein was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.</p></li>
